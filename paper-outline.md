# Comparison of 2-mirror unobscured objectives for a 3U Cubesat Payload for space-based optical imaging
1) Review of CubeSat applications, e.g. why optical imaging is necessary in space and advantages of unobscured solutions
2) Methods of design (e.g. MM ML LM LL design spaces, hypothesized tradeoffs in FOV, transmission, performance)
3) Results (show characteristic solution for each design space)
4) Design Space
5) Design Study - Hyperspectral Imager in 3U with design space selection
6) Future Work
